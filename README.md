<h2><ins>Project One: Analysis of Data Structures</ins></h2>

**1. What was the problem you were solving in Project One?**

The problem in Project One involved analyzing the run-time and memory usage of various data structures. The goal was to understand the performance characteristics of these data structures under different scenarios.

**2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

To tackle this problem, I implemented several common data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees. By running tests and benchmarks, I measured their run-time complexities and memory usage. Understanding data structures is crucial because it allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data, which is fundamental in designing high-performance software systems.

**3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

I overcame roadblocks by consulting relevant resources such as textbooks, online tutorials, and documentation. Additionally, discussing challenges with classmates and seeking help from the instructor.

**4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

Working on this project expanded my approach to designing software by emphasizing the importance of selecting the appropriate data structure based on the requirements of the problem. It also reinforced the significance of considering run-time complexity and memory efficiency in software design decisions.

**5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

This project has encouraged me to write programs that are modular, well-documented, and adhere to best practices. By structuring code in a clear and organized manner, it becomes more maintainable and readable. Additionally, incorporating design patterns and abstraction techniques has enhanced the adaptability of my programs to future changes and requirements.


<h2><ins>Project Two: Sorting and Printing Courses</ins></h2>

**1. What was the problem you were solving in Project Two?**

The problem in Project Two involved sorting and printing a list of courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order.

**2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

To solve this problem, I implemented a sorting algorithm to arrange the list of courses in alphanumeric order. Understanding data structures allowed me to efficiently store and manipulate the course data, enabling effective sorting and printing operations.

**3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

I overcame roadblocks by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks and tackling them one at a time. Referring to documentation and seeking assistance from peers helped me overcome specific challenges related to sorting algorithms and string manipulation.

**4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

This project expanded my approach to designing software by reinforcing the importance of modularity and scalability. By designing the sorting and printing functionalities as separate components, the program becomes more adaptable to future changes, such as adding new courses or modifying the sorting criteria.

**5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

Working on this project has reinforced the importance of writing clean, well-structured code that is easy to understand and maintain. By following naming conventions, writing descriptive comments, and using meaningful variable names, the code becomes more readable and adaptable to future modifications or enhancements.
